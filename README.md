# MVVMDemoKotlin

This sample, written in Kotlin, demonstrates MVVM architecture using Data Binding, Android Architecture Components and provides a seemless endless movie list scrolling from server (https://developers.themoviedb.org) in RecyclerView. This sample use Retrofit2 to make api calls and uses Picasso to get images. 

The basic concept is that it fetches the data from the API to see the latest or popular movies and provides a button to filter them. when the user clicks on any item, it shows the basic details of the movie.
